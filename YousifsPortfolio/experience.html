            <h1>My Experience</h1>
            <h4>This page highlights my professional and personal experiences.</h4>

            <p>I don't have much experience working for any tech field thus far in my Software Development journey. However, towards the end of my journey I look forward to a internship towards that hopefully will grant me more experience. Currently, I work in Customer Service and have been doing so for 3 years and a half as of writing this. I look forward to finishing my journey in Software Development at <span style="font-weight: bold;">The College of Western Idaho</span> and get hired for my first Software Developer job and starting to build my experience and career.</p> <br>
            <p>Below highlights my personal hobbies and projects I worked on during my educational career. 3D Printing is a hobby I got an interest in upon seeing the cool things that can be created from scratch. The 3D printed object is a headphone holder that attaches to the desk. However unfortunatily, it broke. I have sense printed and worked on another better design by someone else, that was fun to work on and assemble together using screws. They were both not my own models, but they were extremely fun to print, especially the second model because it required some assembly.</p> <br>
            <p>For the coding projects, those were extremely fun to work on as well, I learned a lot from those projects in class and I hope to carry that knowlege with me into the field in the future.
