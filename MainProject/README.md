# The Adventures of a Lifetime

## What is this project?
Context: This project serves as story of a young adventurer with a great need to do whats right, and is nearly every time presented with with tough choices and wherever his choices lead, the next ones gradually get tougher. The adventurer simply wants to do good, keep evil at bay, and spread kindness in a world full of madness.

~~This is also a class a project, I'm only doing what I'm told because I have to, but we're gonna pretend I didn't say that so I can keep my grad... oooh look shiny. (I lowkey am enjoying working on this project.)~~

## Installation:
Not much installation needed. ~~REJOICE~~ However, all that is really need is the Main.java file, run it in a Java capable IDE such as VS CODE (but requires the right extentions to make Java capable). ~~lowkey the best. I will die on that hill.~~

~~Can you tell I love making these?~~

## How to use this project.
At the start of the program, The user must answer the questions when this Project is run, and are greeted with a story, and must follow that story by choosing which path the adventurer will take. Depending on the choice, different paths with different stories and choices that a user must make will be present. Think of it like a choose your own adventure kind of deal, and guide the adventurer through the paths chosen.

## Step by step guide through the project:
```
///Prologue and Chapter 1///
!!Answer the questions at start, a System.out.print block of statements will execute displaying the Prologue!!
- Choice 1- When it prompts a input, choose between a short path, or a long path for the character Journey to begin Chapter 1.
    - For example: Typing "shorter" will yield the story result of the adventurer taking the shorter path to the destination. It will be similar all throughout.
- Choice 2- After choosing a path, another choice prompt will be ran, ask if the user wishes to stay on the same path, or choose a different path.
- Choice 3- In this choice, the you are prompted to choose to stay at a Inn by typing 'shorter' or continue the adventure without giving the adventurer a stop by typing 'longer'.
- Choice 4- This choice is set a day later after the adventurer leaves the in, when prompted, enter a number of torches the adventurer places around the camp.


///Chapter 2///
!!In this chapter Arrays are introduced, allowing for a better form of code that may reduce code clutter!!
- Choice 5- Choose whether to fight or sneak past monsters. Note: I made the shorter path easier and added rewards.
- Choice 5a- If chosen to fight in the shorter path, lesser and easier monsters will encountered, who drop loot when defeated. HOWEVER, the longer path takes... longer with tougher monsters who drop no loot.
    - Type 'fight' or 'sneak' to choose to confront the monsters, or get past them without the rewards for defeating them.

## Key features
```
!! In this project I use (so far): !!
- If-else statements to give user a choice to make.
- while loops dependent on the choices made.
- Switch statement to give the user a chance to fight or sneak past danger.
- Arrays to give each path its own number of monsters.
- Methods to add some immersive depth and allow the user to feel in control.

TO BE CONTINUED!!!

~~maybe slightly predetermined number of monsters... oops.~~

## Explaining the code.
The if-else loops appear at through out the project, which let the user make a choice for the character, further advances the story. The while loop is depended on the choice made in the if-else loop above, if the user chooses Shorter, it will be skipped and the for loop will be entered. The for loop allows the user to choose how many torches the adventurer places around camp to light up the area and increase visibility.

The arrays are self explanatory, they show a number of monster the user must guide their adventurer through, which path seems the most viable to the user. I also added switch statements to give the user a choice, if they choose to fight, a SWITCH statement intended as a reward block will execute. Explained in the code as well.

New methods are meant as great depth additions to the code that allow for further interaction and immersion into the story.
## What's planned?
So far, not much. This project will continue being expanded as I, the author, continue learning how, to the best of my ability and knowledge, continue expanding this project. Improving upon functionality and performance, and making it the best experience it can be for the user. I will continue to add more story content as well and refining it further to make sense, it's current state, I feel like improvement can be made.

As of right now, battles are one-sides, in the future I hope to make the monsters fight back. Give a little back and forth immersion.

About this README file. I will try to keep this file up to date along side my development for the project, especially the step by step section of this README file.
